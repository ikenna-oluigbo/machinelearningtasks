Understanding Network Representation Learning Paradigm: A Practical Approach  

This repository contains the code related to the research of Ikenna Oluigbo, Hamida Seba and Mohammed Haddad

Abstract
Graphs contains lots of insightful structural and contextual attributes amongst its structures and sub-structures,
which can be harnessed for lots of learning tasks. For example, given a peer-to-peer file sharing network, we
want to build a model to detect anomaly between peered client or to derive a new knowledge in the connected
network. Unlike traditional graph representation paradigms which would have made this almost impossible; if
we can represent nodes, links or the entire network in low dimensional vector embedding with its structure and
attributes intact, then we can perform a number of learning tasks on the embedding to derive knowledge. In
this study, we extend a previous study by carrying out extensive survey and applications of network embedding.
We divide the work into three schemes; basically encompassing discussing embedding paradigms for network
representation learning in broad details, coupled with the various embedding outputs. We also classify various
learning tasks and evaluate selected models with a number of machine learning tasks. On the flip-side, we also
extensively discuss advances made in different embedding techniques and further compared the computational
complexities of different models. We conclude the survey with result discussions and we propose areas for further
studies.

STUDY

We propose a detailed survey on network representation learning techniques, and conducted a number of experimental learning tasks 
to evaluate the models. The tasks includes Outlier Detection, Clustering, Link Prediction, Runtime and Space Computation.
