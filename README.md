# Understanding Network Representation Learning Paradigm: A Practical Approach  
This repository contains the code related to the research of Ikenna Oluigbo, Hamida Seba and Mohammed Haddad

# STUDY
This code relates to a detailed survey on network representation learning models, with a number of experimental learning tasks 
to evaluate the models. The tasks includes Outlier Detection, Clustering, Link Prediction, Runtime and Space Computation. 

# DATA
All datasets used in this study were gotten from SNAP Datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection (2014), publicly 
downloadable from http://snap.stanford.edu/data.
